Instructions
============

This project is (initially) generated by `eliom-distillery` as the basic
project `blibli`.

Generated files
---------------

The following files in this directory have been generated by
eliom-distillery:

 - blibli.eliom
   This is your initial source file.

 - static/
   The content of this folder is statically served. Put your CSS or
   additional JavaScript files here

 - Makefile.options
   Configure your project here

 - blibli.conf.in
   This file is a template for the configuration file for
   ocsigenserver. You will rarely have to edit itself - it takes its
   variables from the Makefile.options. This way, the installation
   rules and the configuration files are synchronized with respect to
   the different folders.

 - Makefile
   This contains all rules necessary to build, test, and run your
   Eliom application. You better don't touch it ;) See below for the
   relevant targets.

 - local/
   This directory is the target of the temporary installation of
   your application, to test locally before doing a system-wide
   installation in /. Do not put anything manually here.


Makefile targets
----------------

Build and run the project with

```
make test.opt
```
